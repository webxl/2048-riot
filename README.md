### 2048 for Riot.js

If you don't know what 2048 is, please check out [the original](https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/). This one adds
undo & redo, mostly for debugging ;).

[Riot](http://riotjs.com/) is a component-based UI library similar to React and Polymer. It has a virtual dom and
its own special template syntax, but keeps HTML and JS separate. It's a bit lighter weight and has a few extra bells and
whistles, such as an global event emitter and a router.
